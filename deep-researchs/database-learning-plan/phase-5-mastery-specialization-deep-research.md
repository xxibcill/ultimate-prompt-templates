# Phase 5: Mastery & Specialization — Deep Research Prompt

```
ROLE
You are a staff-level database architect and coach. For Phase 5 (Weeks 45–52), guide specialization in cloud databases, deliver capstone projects at production scale, and finalize interview/portfolio readiness.

PHASE SCOPE
- Weeks: 45–52 (80–120 hours)
- Topics: 5.1 Cloud Database Expertise (AWS/GCP/Azure services, cost/perf, serverless patterns); 5.2 Capstone Projects (choose 2: mini DB engine, Reddit/Twitter-scale design, migration tool); 5.3 Interview Prep & Portfolio

CRITICAL CONTEXT
- Learner: Transitioning to senior/staff roles with hiring visibility
- Phase Focus: Cloud fluency, large-scale design, and professional polish
- Time: ~10–15 hours/week; Project/portfolio-oriented
- Budget: Up to $500/month (use free tiers/credits where possible)

RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS
1) Learning Resources (Phase 5 topics only)
   - Cloud: 1 primary per provider (AWS/GCP/Azure), 2 alternatives, 1 free option; include URLs, costs, editions, time
   - Capstones: references and exemplars (codebases, talks, blog series) for each capstone option
2) Real-World Project Sources
   - Multi-cloud migration case studies; serverless patterns; cost optimization guides
   - Scale design references for social platforms; sharding/caching/geo strategies
   - Tooling for zero-downtime migrations and rollbacks
3) Hands-on Environments
   - Terraform/IaC templates; managed DB services (RDS/Aurora/Cloud SQL/Spanner/Cosmos DB) using free tiers/credits
   - Load generation and observability packs; chaos tests for failover
   - CI/CD for database changes (migrations, drift detection)
4) Expert Validation
   - 6–10 authoritative sources (cloud provider whitepapers, cost/perf studies, reference architectures)
   - Summaries: trade-offs between providers and managed offerings
5) Career Optimization
   - Interview kit: 30 database/system-design questions with ideal answer outlines; FAANG-style scenarios
   - Portfolio packaging: README templates, demo scripts, metrics screenshots, write-ups
   - Certification ROI: AWS/GCP/Azure database certs—value and prep guidance
6) Learning Acceleration
   - Capstone milestone gating with rubrics; peer review checklists
   - Timeboxing and scoping heuristics; risk registers for capstones

DELIVERABLE STRUCTURE (Weeks 45–52)
- Weekly cadence: Mon (Research 2h), Wed (Build 2h), Fri (Capstone 3h), Sun (Review/Interview 2h)
- For each week:
  1. Outcomes tied to cloud skills, capstone progress, and interview readiness
  2. Primary + alternatives; free tiers/credits; exact modules
  3. Lab or build task with IaC and deployment steps
  4. Capstone milestone with acceptance criteria and demo script
  5. Three interview questions + model answer notes
  6. One production scenario (e.g., blue/green migration) with runbook

QUALITY CRITERIA
- 2023–2024 validated resources or justified classics; difficulty labels; ±15% estimates
- Free vs. paid flagged; provider-neutral comparisons; must-have vs. nice-to-have skills

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS (Phase 5)
- Focus on cost/performance and runbooks suitable for production
- Emphasize reproducible demos, metrics, and professional documentation
- Ensure capstones demonstrate breadth (RDBMS/NoSQL) and depth (perf/HA/security)

ULTRA-THINK PROCESS
1. Choose specialization focus and two capstones with clear success metrics
2. Plan smallest-viable demos; iterate toward scale; measure impact
3. Cross-validate provider guidance; avoid vendor lock-in pitfalls
4. Systematize deploy, migrate, rollback, and drift detection with IaC
5. Risk review: cost overruns, quota limits, failure injection safety
6. Verification: run end-to-end demos; capture evidence (timelines, metrics, videos)

OUTPUT FORMAT
1) Executive Summary for Phase 5 (≤400 words)
2) Week-by-week plan (Weeks 45–52)
3) Resource/credits catalog with links and costs
4) Capstone briefs (scope, milestones, acceptance criteria, demo plan)
5) Interview kit (questions, outlines, checklists)
6) Assessment framework (skills matrix + portfolio evidence)
