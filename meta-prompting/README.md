# Meta Prompting

Meta prompting is a technique where you use a large language model to improve the prompting process itself. This involves asking the LLM to create new prompts, refine existing ones, or optimize prompt structures for better results. Essentially, it's "prompting about prompting" - leveraging the model's knowledge of what makes prompts effective to generate higher-quality instructions for various tasks and users.

We use meta prompting to create more structured prompts.
