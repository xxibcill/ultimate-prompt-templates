# Plyometrics Research Plan — Part 2: Training

## **4. Exercise Progression and Types**

### **Beginner Progression (Foundation Phase)**

A progression of plyometric intensity is always prudent, especially for those returning to activity from previous injury - drills should be progressed from low to medium to high intensity, with two-legged drills being a good starting point.

**Foundation Exercises:**

- Drop squats (learning landing mechanics)
- Snap downs
- Box step-ups/step-downs
- Jump rope (2-3 minutes)
- Lateral hops (5-15 reps)

### **Intermediate Progression**

Speed skater hops are similar to side-to-side hops but require the athlete to decelerate their body after a lateral bound with only one leg. Alternating lunge jumps teach the legs to absorb and transfer force in both quadriceps and hamstring dominant positions, which is invaluable for injury prevention.

**Intermediate Exercises:**

- Countermovement jumps
- Broad jumps
- Multiple consecutive jumps (3-5 in a row)
- Tuck jumps
- Single-leg hops

### **Advanced Progression**

The focus of this phase is to move through the full spectrum of velocities, planes, directions, and sport-related patterns - introducing multiple loading variables and skills into sequences.

**Advanced Exercises:**

- Depth jumps from varying heights
- Reactive jumps
- Combination movements (depth drop to box jump)
- Sport-specific patterns

## **5. Programming Variables and Periodization**

### **Volume Guidelines**

For beginners, an optimal amount is 60 ground contacts per session; intermediate athletes should program 80-120 contacts per week; advanced athletes are recommended 120 or more ground contacts per session.

The length of plyometric training interventions varied from 4 to 36 weeks, with most trials opting for a 12-week intervention period, with weekly training sessions set at either two or three times per week.

### **Frequency and Recovery**

Recovery between training sessions is usually 48 to 72 hours between exercise bouts with plyometrics. Moderate training frequency and volume (2 days per week, 840 jumps) produces similar enhancements in jumping performance but greater training efficiency compared with high frequency training (4 days per week, 1680 jumps).

### **Periodization Models**

Periodization involves systematic fluctuation of training volume, intensity, and sport-specific skill - training should progressively become more intense with less volume as athletes approach the end of their in-season mesocycle.

Research shows that plyometric training programs following different overload patterns but with equal training loads showed similar performance effects in recreationally trained individuals.

## **6. Safety Considerations and Contraindications**

### **Prerequisites for Safe Training**

The most significant contraindication to plyometrics is when the athlete does not have foundational strength or training base upon which a plyometric program can be built.

Guidelines recommend having good squat form under load (at least 60% of total body weight) and full range of motion in joints that will be used during the activity.

### **Absolute Contraindications**

Examples of contraindications include: pain, inflammation, acute or sub-acute sprains and strains, joint instability, and soft tissue limitations based on postoperative conditions.

Plyometric exercise is contraindicated in the immediate postoperative period, in the presence of acute inflammation or pain, and in athletes with gross shoulder or elbow instability.

### **Injury Prevention Strategies**

Research shows that landing training, even short-term, improves jump height and decreases the risk of injury from landing impact.

Poor landing mechanics can strain joints and lead to injuries, particularly in knees and ankles - athletes should land softly with knees slightly bent and tracking over the toes.
